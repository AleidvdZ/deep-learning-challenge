## Module 21 Challenge  
The purpose of this challenge is to create a tool that can help a fictious nonprofit foundation "Alphabet Soup" to select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures.  The challenge will use machine learning and neural networks to create a binary classifier from the given dataset.

## Process and Resources
### Timeline/Insights:  
0919 Created repository and organized files  
0921 Completed a small amount of preprocessing coding; Formatted README.md; Created a WIP (Work in Process) folder to save file downloads from Google Colaboratory to demonstrate progress in coding.

### Files and Links used for Reference:  
Module 21 Day 1 and 2 activities  
Basic searches for Pandas coding refresher
